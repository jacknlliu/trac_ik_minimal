# trac_ik_minimal
Minimal dependencies and lightweight version of trac_ik for cross-platform and easy-to-use with basic C++ libraries.

[TRAC-IK](https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik/src/b6582a309984ad1daa02697c74ec8fa1ff7150ab/trac_ik_lib/?at=master) is a state of art robot inverse kinematics library. But it depend on ROS and many other libraries which lead to not easy to use in other platforms and not easy to use out of ros and some libraries.


This trac_ik library will be stripped of the ROS dependencies, and lightweight, easy to use in any robotic platform with basic C++ libraries.
